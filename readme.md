# What is this?
This is an example re-implementation of some [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com/) GUI's in the Godot game engine.
This isn't meant to step on any toes - in fact, it's made out of a serious appreciation of the game.

# Why is this?
Implementing an existing product, such as a game or UI, is a great way to practice your software development skills.
Its also a great way to learn the ins and outs of a game engine! Since you don't have to focus on novel design, you can instead have clear goals and behaviors.

# What should I do with this?
Hopefully there will be a video going over this on [the channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMCeSdXq6d3Zghx28U7IGvw). In the mean time, you can check this out, launch it in the Godot Mono editor, and see how close we got.
However, what I really recommend is you follow this project's example and write the code yourself! That is the best way to learn and find out what you'd really do on your own project.
Its also a great way to learn what ideas you have that were good, bad, or mismatched with your expectations.

# How do I run this?
There is an included LFS binary of the Mono Godot that you can run and open this project.
